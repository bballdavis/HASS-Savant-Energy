# Savant Energy Home Assistant Integration

Welcome to the **Savant Energy** integration for Home Assistant! This project brings Savant relay and energy monitoring devices into your smart home, providing real-time power, voltage, relay control, and more‚Äîall with a beautiful, open-source touch.

## üöÄ Features
- **Automatic device discovery** from your Savant system
- **Power and voltage sensors** for each relay
- **Relay (breaker) switch control** with configurable cooldown
- **Binary sensors** for relay status
- **Button entities** for diagnostics and control
- **DMX address sensors** for advanced users

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (via HACS)
1. **Add the repository to HACS**:
   - In Home Assistant, go to **HACS > Integrations > Custom repositories**.
   - Add your fork or this repo's URL: `https://github.com/bballdavis/hass-savant-pbc`.
   - Set category to **Integration**.
2. **Install the integration**:
   - Search for **Savant Energy** in HACS and click **Install**.
3. **Restart Home Assistant** to load the integration.
4. **Add the integration**:
   - Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**.
   - Search for **Savant Energy** and follow the prompts (enter your Savant controller's IP, port, and OLA port if needed).

## ‚ö° How to Use
Once installed and configured, the integration will automatically create entities for each Savant relay device it discovers. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see:

### Entity Breakdown
- **Power Sensor (`sensor.<device>_power`)**: Shows the real-time power usage (Watts) for each relay.
- **Voltage Sensor (`sensor.<device>_voltage`)**: Displays the current voltage (Volts) for each relay.
- **Breaker Switch (`switch.<device>_breaker`)**: Lets you turn the relay on/off. Includes a configurable cooldown (default: 30 seconds) to prevent rapid toggling and protect your hardware.
- **Relay Status Binary Sensor (`binary_sensor.<device>_relay_status`)**: Indicates if the relay is currently ON or OFF.
- **DMX Address Sensor (`sensor.<device>_dmx_address`)**: (Advanced) Shows the DMX address assigned to the relay.
- **Diagnostic Buttons**:
  - **All Loads On**: Instantly turns on all relays.
  - **API Command Log**: Logs a sample DMX API command for troubleshooting.
  - **API Stats**: Shows DMX API health and statistics.

## üìù Configuration Options
- **IP Address**: The address of your Savant controller.
- **Port**: The port for energy snapshot data (default: 2000).
- **OLA Port**: The port for DMX/OLA API (default: 9090).
- **Scan Interval**: How often to poll for new data (default: 15s).
- **Breaker Cooldown**: Minimum seconds between relay toggles (default: 30s).
- **DMX Testing Mode**: Enable for advanced DMX testing (optional).
